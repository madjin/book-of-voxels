## Abstract

Want to show past and future combined in an artistic, post apoc way. **You don't need to do a desert theme**, I just think that it illustrates the concept of time eloquently.

**Lost Oasis**

The juxtaposition between hard voxels shapes and organic foliage is quite interesting, would be cool to have the user go through a graveyard of voxels towards a secret club where a bunch of avatars are forever dancing to a music - a small oasis of archived metaverse content in a sea of bit rot.

- https://github.com/madjin/Cryptovoxels-snapshots (2019 FBX files in here are fine)
    - https://skfb.ly/oyOxO Main assets here
        - https://github.com/esperecyan/VRMConverterForVRChat If using glTF in Unity can use this plugin

:::info
Can request Unity project from jin, has assets imported + baked occlusion culling, only downside is low performance
