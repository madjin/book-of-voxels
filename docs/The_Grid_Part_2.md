### Origin City VRC

This layer is the foundation for the internet city. The picture below is a high resolution render.

Importing the entire city to Blender in hopes to optimize and re-export did not work out.

Instead focused on a chunk of the city with a single district (Makers). Screenshot is from Unity.

The Cryptovoxels avatar was optimized, rigged, and uploaded to VRChat as Quest compatible.

Here is a player standing in the VRChat version of Makers district staring into a mirror.

Squad rolling through the neighborhood. Avatars in VRC can be really big and really small.

Riding Chocobos through the district, not recommended for VR users.

Basic MVP of the CV district is uploaded with links below, feel free to jump in and take a look.

### Desert City

![](https://i.imgur.com/cCbYKAO.jpg)

Desert City is a sandbox for web based mixed reality. The images are from a 1 day experiment.

The [arcade tent experiment](https://streamable.com/l5na2) is given presence in a world with thought to having an exterior.

Going through the door will take you to inside the arcade tent, hosted on another site.

### Trailer Park

This area of the map is reserved for portable housing units, or trailers as most people see it.

If the Internet were a video game, the trailer would be like a portable startpage + save point.

### Night

Night mode is still a work-in-progress with the aim to turn the desert city into a neon lit metropolis.

The animated spline paths are the result of [Spyduck](https://spyduck.net) wanting to have tilt-brush like animations in Janus.  This process can be used to light up buildings, roads, avatars, and vehicles at night.

### Projection Mapping 

Scan of an entire city skyline was done using open source photogrammetry.

This became the base for UVmapping video textures onto (live or prerecorded).

Hologram vocaloid music video was then quickly added into the scene. The video texture for the buildings needs to be tweaked since its not very dynamic.
