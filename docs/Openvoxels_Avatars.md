### Notes

Tried to first add an image and new VRM field separately, didn't work. The metadata for new fields isn't showing up:

- https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85/89309112019529632356319028869398151961865130758109557318354337679874954264347
    - https://metadata.ens.domains/mainnet/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85/89309112019529632356319028869398151961865130758109557318354337679874954264347

Now a platform can fetch the NFT metadata belonging to the primary ENS addresses' avatar which contains the direct link to the VRM if the minting was done right. Some possible issues:

- no standard field for VRM yet
    - [animation_url example](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xae09345adc2b7133a5533bfbdb088bd6f40448d9/8)
    - [asset example](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbac0b85ce8a5bad5a0a79088f223871a476cedb6/0)
    - [manifold vrm_url example](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x41eb9dd376c9a3f1c02e5f3f89f22ad6ae970d51/17)

> For platforms to integrate it's probably best to implement certain contracts individually which is what hyperfy.io is doing or search for the file extension.

> Turn subdomain into a NFT, would be interesting for webxr.eth, vrmchat.eth, hyperfy.eth

## Preview image with VRM

VRM files can have a preview thumbnail encoded within them alongside the metadata containing usage rights.

It would be cool to have different preview images for an ENS NFT avatar: one trading card version like on cryptoavatars.io and another ENS domain version which has a square aspect ratio which can be derived from the VRM preview image.

Even found EXIF data about the thumbnail data within the VRM export.

It'd be nice if model viewer had VRM support, will make a new discussion on the github. Models can have automatic poster.
