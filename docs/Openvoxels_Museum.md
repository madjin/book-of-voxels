In 2019 we covered the story of the pioneers experimenting at the intersection of crypto and virtual worlds that can communicate or interop with each other. They were looking for ways to reuse the things they made in a platform outside of it, without needing to ask for permission. The whole attraction to blockchain was this concept of digital ownership, so having the assets you supposedly owned being locked in one platform seemed antithetical to the overall idea.

**3 year update**

It's been three years since we last checked in with M3, an online collective of artists and hackers at the prefessus of the open metaverse.

In that time, they've been busy experimenting with new ways virtual world platforms outside of the ways they were designed to be used, exploring the potential of technologies at the intersection of 3D web and blockchain.

## First Room


> Talk about in the beginning, a bunch of us VR developers who worked on other platforms landed in voxels Makers district and began to build portals to our other projects. The city started to grow, especially after Ben added NFT image support - that's when things really took off.


These experiments were mostly happening pro-bono. We have had 4 years of interop history, and suddenly NFTs and the metaverse EXPLODED onto the scene and became household names the world was talking about out it was just a few of us on the edge of technology experimenting.

Voxels is the first of its kind to ship a virtual world with smart contract integration. Ben Nolan, who is an OG WebVR dev, was working on it on the side as a solo dev while Decentraland raised 25M and didn't ship a public client until a year after Voxels was live.

We captured a slice of history in retrospect, because NFTs were still extremely niche back then in 2019-2020. The scene didn't really explode onto the scene until when the Beeple art sold for 69M in 2021. That's when things really took off..

We made a metaverse time machine app using Hyperfy  SDK to create and explore snapshots that travel between time periods.

But as we know, virtual worlds are ephemeral. Money has poured into the scene, washing away the culture and early metaverse pioneer history. These stories are often ignored by the incumbents. But thanks to the efforts of M3 org and others, there’s hope for a more open and accessible metaverse.

One fascinating aspect of our activities is its ability to provide users with a window to the past. By loading archived snapshots of virtual worlds, users can experience how these digital environments have evolved and changed over time. This unique perspective offers valuable insights into the history and development of virtual spaces, providing a richer understanding of the metaverse’s progression and the pioneers who helped shape it.

## AI Notes

> help me write a voice over script for a video documentary about the online experiments M3 org has been doing with cryptovoxels over the last 3 years after the last video we produced. The outline for the video goes as follows:
>
> Intro: fast montage of new stuff
> First part: Recap of Cryptovoxels+ 2019 video, the unsung story of pioneers paving an open metaverse experimenting with ways to permissionlessly use the things we made in a platform outside of it.
> 
> Second part: Avatar Interop + VRM, taking my Voxels avatar character and exporting it for use across all sorts of different metaverse platforms and games that support the VRM file format
> 
> 
> Third part: Talking about the Hyperfy.io app we made for taking snapshots of UGC parcels, did a new snapshot exactly 3 years after the last one which allows us to go between two different time periods
> 
> Ending is Internet Archive / Wayback machine concept
> Virtual worlds ephemeral, lots of money came into the scene, washed away the culture / early metaverse pioneer history, ignored by the incumbents.
> 
> Use a cool tone, like Vice documentary style, not too overly technical or nerdy

NARRATOR:
It's been three years since we last checked in with M3 org, the pioneers of the open metaverse. In that time, they've been busy experimenting with new ways to use the platform and exploring the potential of emerging technologies.

**FIRST PART:**
> [Clips from the 2019 video, overlayed with new footage of Cryptovoxels]

NARRATOR:
In 2019, we told the unsung story of the pioneers paving the way for an open metaverse. They were experimenting with ways to permissionlessly use the things they made in a platform outside of it. Today, their vision has evolved.

**SECOND PART:**
> [Clips of Avatar Interop and VRM technology]

NARRATOR:
Now, M3 org is taking things a step further with Avatar Interop and VRM. By exporting their Voxels avatar characters for use across different metaverse platforms and games, they're paving the way for a more interconnected and open virtual world.

**THIRD PART:**
> [Clips of the Hyperfy.io app in action]

NARRATOR:
One of the latest projects from M3 org is the Hyperfy.io app. By taking snapshots of user-generated content parcels, the team has created a time machine of sorts. With a new snapshot taken exactly three years after the last one, they can now travel between two different time periods in the metaverse.
