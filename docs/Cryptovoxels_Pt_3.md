## Geocities Effect

[The Geocities Effect](http://anarchyarcade.com/concept.html#geocities) is a concept that originated from [Anarchy Arcade](http://anarchyarcade.com/), a 3D desktop engine, which refers to the idea that the person who created a custom desktop in AArcade will also be the person who enjoys it the most.

What looks like an epic room (or 2D desktop) full of amazing content & nostalga for one person can look like a poorly textured space full of random junk to somebody else.

## Networks

**Metcalfe's Law**: The value of a network is proportional to the square of participants.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0YBevUI.png)

Put simply, every time you connect another person into a network, and therefore able to make many more connections, the impact is multiplied, and becomes exponential.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YtUFLcE.png)

This effect has observed by the rapid adoption of social media platforms over the past decade. As more people create social media profiles and connect to their friends, the network becomes bigger and more valuable to users and investors alike.

Cryptovoxels has built a platform that makes it easy for individuals to personalize a 3D website with images, models, links, music, and other interactive elements without prior knowledge of coding required.

The ease of personalizing 3D websites with the out-of-the-box connections with a larger grid, Origin City, are we seeing Metcalfe's Law in action happening inside Cryptovoxels?

Uses quite a lot less RAM now - not storing textures in RAM once uploaded to GPU. CryptoVoxels world takes about 15GB RAM now instead of 24GB.

## Optimizations

Halved the bundle size with no loss of functionality!

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rc9q956.jpg)

26mb -> 13mb. 50% reduction in bundle size means that it'll transfer over the network in half the time, and use half as much ram to load the javascript

"...I just refactored the parcel loading code and it's approximately a thousand times faster. ZERO LAG."

## JanusWeb

In order to build a JanusWeb client for Cryptovoxels, the geometry had to be first exported from the Unity engine to glTF. The [gltf-exporter](https://github.com/Plattar/gltf-exporter) plugin from Plattar worked great.

The parcels can optionally be loaded into Blender for further optimization.
