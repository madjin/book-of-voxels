## Notes

Based on the transcript, here is a bullet point summary of what was discussed, questions asked, and action steps being taken or planned:

- Jin provided an overview of his work on preserving and improving the metadata/assets for CryptoVoxels wearables to make them more interoperable and future-proof.
- He took snapshots of all wearable creators, collectors, and metadata to analyze for potential community governance.
- He improved wearable thumbnails, converted models to GLTF, encoded metadata into models, and hosted everything decentralized on Arweave.

Key points/questions discussed:
- Whether to release an all-new consolidated wearables collection or update existing collections
- Challenges of getting every collection owner to update their metadata
- Benefits of a consolidated collection for discoverability 
- Exploring a community-owned DAO model for the consolidated collection
- Attributing authorship for collaborative/community collections
- Potential to integrate wearables into other metaverse platforms like Substrata

Action steps/plans:
- Release dataset of wearable snapshots and metadata for community input
- Explore upgrading metadata for a test existing collection 
- Set up a testnet/subset for a potential consolidated new collection
- Engage community to decide path forward for consolidated vs updating existing
- Integrate wearables into M3's open source VRM avatar toolkit
- Explore VRM export for parcels and avatars
- Pursue more cross-metaverse/platform integration for CryptoVoxels wearables
- Establish community governance/ownership model like a DAO

Overall, a major initiative to make CryptoVoxels wearables robustly interoperable while preserving their history, with openness to community direction on the specific approach
