# Openvoxels Load Faster

**Budget**: 0.50 ETH

- **Files**: https://github.com/madjin/Cryptovoxels-snapshots/tree/master/glb-models
- **Code**: https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh
- **World**: https://hyperfy.io/origincity

**Problem**: The Origin City world takes 10 minutes to load because it's recalculating the BVH each time you load and there's millions of triangles.

**Proposal**: Upgrade three-mesh-bvh version for 30-40% performance boost, and to run on web workers for up to 4x faster generation of BVH. Then implement range options and custom BVH glTF extension to preload a computed BVH.

The goal is to reduce initial load time for big worlds, such as Openvoxels snapshots from 2 minutes every time on load to as little as possible, which is theoretically a matter of seconds.

> Changelog: https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh
> - https://x.com/garrettkjohnson/status/1828452607368823246 disabling mipmaps + plugin system
> - https://x.com/garrettkjohnson/status/1825452623513911628
> - Add range option to MeshBVH 7/17/24
> - Improved raycasting performancy by ~20% by avoiding use of the "arrayToBox" function internally. (4/10/24)
> - Added new "ParallelMeshBVHWorker" that parallelizes MeshBVH generation across multiple WebWorkers. Falls back to a single threaded approach if SharedArrayBuffer is not supported. (1/30/24)
> - Small performance improvements to bvhcast function (up to ~10%). (10/8/23)
> - Added support for draw range so the BVH now implicitly respects the start and end range specified in the geometry. (8/30/23)

0.75 is 15% faster from skipped array -> box conversion and BVH traversal now supports raycaster near / far fields

> Thanks to the contribution, a new BVH can be constructed from a geometry subrange which can be used for BatchedMesh sub geometry!
