# Voxels vs Decentraland VRM Exports

Comparing VRM avatar exports from @cryptovoxels and @decentraland / digital fashion interop post

I'm working on the Voxels VRMs via @openvoxels. It's almost done, can still change things perhaps based on feedback here.

If you want to export your avatar from Decentraland you can do so in-game, live now

VRM was designed for interop, hence why part of the spec is dedicated to encoding license info in the files themselves. Here's a look at two samples side by side in Blender via [Saturday06's VRM addon](https://github.com/saturday06/VRM-Addon-for-Blender).

Voxels has a full ETH address whereas the DCL one is shortened. IMO it's better to have the full addy 🤷

Both platforms have NFT wearables and contain info about the currently attached ones in the Reference fields. Usually this info gets lost in the process after baking everything together!

The Voxels one links to costume files which has more data (contract address + ID + attachment config info), but since it's hosted on arweave it'll take more steps in order to parse. Most likely it'll be a crypto platform that's interested in authenticity / provenance of these wearables, so in addition to encoding in the VRM file one could encode it as part of the NFT metadata. I recommend checking out Extensible Token Metadata Standard (Shoutout to @Nifty_Island)


> **Complete Example: Multiple Files Per Asset**
> The following is an example of the metadata for an NFT representing an entire outfit. Each asset in the outfit is a 3D model, but also includes a supplementary image file. In addition, the top-level image field is used here to provide a preview of the entire outfit.

Decentraland wearables are mostly designed to be compatible with DCL base meshes. Although some could be kitbashed to other avatar types, it would likely be a messy / hand tailored process although new tools have been emerging to make fitting the same pair of clothes on different base meshes easier.

Voxels wearables were designed in magicavoxel at a max size of 32x32x32 voxels and configured in a babylonjs web app which can export a JSON file of the costume. Costumes files contain the wearables collection address, chain (eth/polygon), wearable id, as well as the bone it's attached to + offset information (pos/rot/scale). It's a beautifully simple avatar wearable system.

 Voxels base mesh is a mannequin, a perfect placeholder if you think about it. Yet another reason why I love testing interop with this platform.

## Minting Avatars

My plan to commemorate the release of Voxels VRMs is to mint them all as NFTs, and airdrop passports to their respectful owners.

Since Decentraland avatars are downloadable on the fly by logging into the explorer, I assume the owner of such wearables could choose to mint the avatar as a NFT via a marketplace / their own contract. Why

I converted the 34015 vox wearables to glTF 2.0 from a snapshot taken in March 2024, [more details here](https://mirror.xyz/openvoxels.eth/FVpOzDZ1vh_1qaGcQ1ZjFNcFfkvvEVR8DvNIWAebXJ0).
